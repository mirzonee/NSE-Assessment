## Development Environment
Editor: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Extension/Tool Used:
- Go: This extension provides rich Go language support, including IntelliSense, code navigation, formatting, and more. You can install it from the Extensions view in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X on macOS) by searching for "Go" and selecting the official extension by Microsoft.
- Postman: Postman is a tool I used to test the API endpoints. It allows for easy construction of HTTP requests to interact with the server.
